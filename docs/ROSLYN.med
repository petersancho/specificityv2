# Lingua System Architecture

## Core Truth
**Lingua has exactly two subsystems:**

1. **Roslyn** - Direct 3D modeling environment
2. **Numerica** - Visual workflow and simulation environment

## The Complete System

- **Lingua** is the overarching philosophical framework and semantic system. It is not an application—it is pure meaning, the unifying concept that contains exactly two subsystems.

- **Roslyn** is the direct modeling subsystem. It provides:
  - WebGL-based 3D viewport
  - Command-driven geometry creation
  - Selection, transformation, gumball manipulation
  - Real-time rendering and visualization

- **Numerica** is the workflow subsystem. It provides:
  - Visual node-based programming
  - Simulator rigs (Box Builder → Goals → Solver)
  - Data processing and parameterization
  - Connection to Roslyn geometry via shared state

## Critical Constraint
There are no other subsystems. Every feature, tool, or capability in Lingua lives within either Roslyn or Numerica. The entire codebase is organized around this binary structure:

- **Client code** = Roslyn UI + Numerica UI + Shared semantic layer
- **Server code** = Workflow computation API (primarily serves Numerica)
- **Documentation** = Explains how Roslyn and Numerica work together

## Shared Foundation
Both subsystems rely on:
- Zustand store (`client/src/store/useProjectStore.ts`)
- Semantic ontology (`client/src/semantic/ontology/`)
- Operation registry (`client/src/semantic/ops/`)
- Geometry kernel (`client/src/geometry/`)

This is the complete Lingua system. Two subsystems. One semantic foundation. No more, no less.
