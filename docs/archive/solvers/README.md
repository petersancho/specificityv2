## Why Archived?

These documents were created during the iterative development of Lingua's solver system. They served their purpose during development but have been superseded by the consolidated, canonical documentation in `docs/SOLVERS.md` and `docs/solvers/`.

**Do not use these documents as authoritative references.**
