# Archive (Historical Phase Docs)

This folder contains point-in-time project logs from the early build phases.
They may reference legacy naming (for example, `ViewerCanvas`) or superseded
implementation details.

When you need the current architecture and APIs, start with:
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/lingua_readme.md`
- `docs/lingua_architecture.md`

Some supporting reference docs remain "current" and live outside this archive folder
(for example, `docs/SHADER_INVENTORY.md`).

## Phase docs

- Phase 1 Audit: `PHASE1_AUDIT.md`
- Phase 2 Complete: `PHASE2_COMPLETE.md`
- Phase 3 Progress: `PHASE3_PROGRESS.md`
- Phase 4 Complete: `PHASE4_COMPLETE.md`
