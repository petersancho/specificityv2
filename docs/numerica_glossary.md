- **Fitness**: Numeric score used to rank genomes.
- **Goal Node**: Node that outputs a structured constraint/objective for a solver.
- **Solver**: Iterative optimizer that searches for a solution.
- **Voxel**: Discrete grid cell used for volumetric analysis.
- **Mesh**: Triangle representation of geometry.
- **NURBS**: Analytic curves/surfaces defined by control points and knots.
- **B‑Rep**: Topological solid model referencing surfaces and edges.
- **Port**: Input/output connection point on a node.
- **Parameter**: Stored node setting used when no input is connected.
- **Dirty Flag**: Internal marker indicating a node needs recomputation.
- **Tessellation**: Converting analytic geometry to triangles.
- **Isosurface**: Surface extracted from a voxel density field.
- **C‑Plane**: Construction plane for geometry creation in Roslyn.
- **Gumball**: Transform gizmo for move/rotate/scale.
